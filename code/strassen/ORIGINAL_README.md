# DSSC - Algorithmic Design - Strassen's Algorithm
This repository contains some code to simplify the implementation and the testing of the Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication.

In order to test the differences in term of execution-time between the naive algorithm and the Strassen's algorithm, you need to implement both the algorithms. The former must be implementated by the function `naive_matrix_multiplication` in the file [matrix.c](matrix.c) and the latter by the function `strassen_matrix_multiplication` in the file [strassen.c](strassen.c).

A Makefile can be produced by using [cmake](https://cmake.org/) as follows:
```bash
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" CMakeLists.txt
```
Afterwards you can compile the code by executing `make`. This produces an executable named `strassen_test` which can be executed in POSIX systems by using the command:
```bash
./strassen_test 
n Naive Alg.  Strassen's Alg. Same result
1	0.000000	0.000000	1
2	0.000000	0.000000	1
4	0.000000	0.000000	1
8	0.000000	0.000000	1
16	0.000000	0.000000	1
32	0.000000	0.000000	1
64	0.000000	0.000000	1
128	0.000000	0.000000	1
256	0.000000	0.000000	1
512	0.000000	0.000000	1
1024	0.000000	0.000000	1
2048	0.000000	0.000000	1
4096	0.000000	0.000000	1
```

The first column in the output report the number of the rows and columns in the tested matrixes. 

The second and third columns in the output reports the execution-time in seconds of the implementations of the naive algorithm and of the Strassen's algorithm, respectively. Since the two algorithms are not implemented in the repository, `strassen_test` initially reports 0 seconds for both of them. 

Finally, the last column, which is excusively meant to validate the implementations, contains the value 1 if and only if the result of the naive algorithm and that of the Strassen's algorithm are the same.
